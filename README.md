# Pocketload - The first webinstaller for Flarum(ish)
* Composer trough web. Upload and run style. 

Currently working on plesk panel. 

Requirements: 
(cUrl) - As of next commit. (Current uses a legacy php function which is often restricted or denied due to the security risks.)
PHP Memory set to 256M - (Not currently tested properly.)

Any input on my coding is greatly appreciated.
